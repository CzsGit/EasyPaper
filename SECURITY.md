# Security and privacy

EasyPaper keeps runtime credentials outside the repository:

- `backend/config/config.yaml` is the local API/JWT/agent configuration. Commit only [`backend/config/config.example.yaml`](backend/config/config.example.yaml).
- `.env` and `.env.*` are ignored; commit only `.env.example`.
- SQLite databases, logs, temporary PDFs, certificates, and local Codex state are ignored.
- The Docker build context excludes the local config, environment files, data, logs, and temporary files.

For Codex mode, authentication is provided by the Codex CLI login belonging to the OS account running the backend. The application does not store a Codex token or copy API keys into the child process environment. Paper text and selected page images are still sent to the Codex account's service when a reading operation runs; choose `llm.provider: "api"` or `llm.provider: "codex"` according to your privacy and retention requirements.

The stock Docker image is configured for the HTTP provider and does not contain a Codex login. To use Codex in Docker, install the CLI in a private image and provide a deliberately mounted Codex home for the backend user; never copy that directory into the image or repository. A host process can use the normal `codex login` flow directly.

Before publishing a branch, run:

```bash
git status --short
git ls-files | rg '(^|/)(\.env|config\.yaml|.*\.(pem|key|p12|pfx)|.*\.(db|sqlite|sqlite3))$'
git grep -n -I -E 'sk-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{16,}|AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{20,}|BEGIN (RSA|OPENSSH|EC) PRIVATE KEY'
```

The first command must not show a local credential file. The second and third commands should return no results for a clean public release. If a real secret has ever been committed, rotate it and rewrite the affected Git history; adding an ignore rule does not remove an old secret from GitHub clones or forks.
